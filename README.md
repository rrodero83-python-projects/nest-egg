### Project 20 - Simulating Retirement Lifetimes
**Objective:**
Build a Monte Carlo simulation for estimating the probability of running out of
money in retirement. Treat years in retirement as a key uncertainty and use
historical stock, bond, and inflation data to capture the observed cyclicity and
dependency of these variables.
